## Reference

This fine-tuning implementation is inspired by OpenAI's official guide:

- [OpenAI Cookbook: How to Fine-Tune Chat Models](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_finetune_chat_models)

The guide outlines how to format prompt-response datasets, select appropriate base models, and configure training parameters for effective chat model fine-tuning.
